Hi! I'm MrPuppeteer. Welcome to my new blog!

I build this blog with Nextjs and Tailwind CSS. I initially wanted to create a blog website from scratch. But to speed up the process, I used a starter template named [Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog/) by @timlrx. And then I just tweaked and modified the code from there.

The motivation behind the blog creation is that I intend to document what I learned, showcase my projects, and maybe share some of my thoughts. Here is a list of topics I may write about in the future.

- Web Development
- UX Design
- Data Science
- Maths
- Psychology

Let me know if you have something to discuss by contacting me below.
