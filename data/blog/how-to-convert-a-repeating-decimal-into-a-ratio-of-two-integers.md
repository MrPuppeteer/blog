We know that $\frac{2}{3}$ is $0.666\bar{6}$, but given the number $0.666\bar{6}$ how could we know its ratio of two integers value is $\frac{2}{3}$?

Let $x = 0.666\bar{6}$

Multiply $x$ by the appropriate powers of $10$, then subtract to eliminate the repeating part.

$\begin{aligned}
10x &= 6.666\bar{6} \\
x &= 0.666\bar{6} \\
9x &= 6 \\
x &= \frac{6}{9} \\
x &= \frac{2}{3}
\end{aligned}$
