GCC compiles a C/C++ program into executable through a sequence of four steps, as depicted in the diagram above. To illustrate, let's consider the command `g++ -o hello hello.cpp`[^1] and break down its execution:

[^1]: It's worth noting that unlike Windows, which typically relies on file extensions like `.exe` to denote directly executable files, Linux/Unix systems often do not use file extensions for this purpose. Instead, they determine the executable type by examining the file itself.

1. Pre-processing: This initial step involves the GNU C Preprocessor (`cpp`), which handles tasks such as including headers (`#include`) and expanding macros (`#define`).

   ```sh
   cpp hello.cpp > hello.i
   ```

   The resultant intermediate file `hello.i` contains the expanded source code.

2. Compilation: The compiler takes the the pre-processed source code and translates it into assembly code specific to the target processor.

   ```sh
   g++ -S hello.i
   ```

   Using the `-S` flag instrructs the compiler to generate assembly code, instead of object code. The resultant assembly file is `hello.s`.

3. Assembly: The assembler (`as`) converts the assembly code into machine code, stored in an object file named `hello.o`.

   ```sh
   as -o hello.o hello.s
   ```

4. Linking: Finally, the linker (`ld`) combines the object code with any required library code to produce the executable file `hello`.

   ```sh
   ld -o hello hello.o ...libraries...
   ```

   If you're still unsure how to link object files using `ld`, you can run the compilation command with verbose mode enabled to get a detailed view of the process as shown below. Additionaly, you can refer to [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14163208/how-to-link-c-object-files-with-ld) for further insights.

## Verbose Mode (`-v`)

To observe a detailed of the compilation process, you can enable the verbose mode by adding the `-v` option along with the compilation command. For instance:

```sh
g++ -v -o hello hello.cpp
```
